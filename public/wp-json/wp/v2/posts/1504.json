Next, ask your physician for a geriatric evaluation consultation for your loved one with a board-certified geriatrician and a referral to a social worker to assist in navigating the medical system.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s wise for anyone older than 55 to have advance directives in place, should they become incapacitated, so a trusted agent can fulfill the patient\u2019s wishes in a dignified manner. Think ahead and plan ahead.<\/p>\n<p>As a family\u2019s planning starts, the issue of competence must be defined. A diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate incompetence or a lack of capacity. At this point, a patient still has the right to make a decision\u2014despite family members disagreeing with it. A patient\u2019s competency should be evaluated after a number of poor choices or an especially serious choice that puts a patient or others at risk.<\/p>\n<p>An evaluation will determine the patient\u2019s factual understanding of concepts, decision-making and cogent expression of choices, the possible consequences of their choices and reasoning of the decision\u2019s pros and cons. Healthcare professionals make the final determination, and these results are provided to the court.<\/p>\n<p>If a patient passes the evaluation, she is deemed to have the mental capacity to make choices on her own. If she cannot demonstrate competency, an attorney can petition the court for a competency hearing, after which a trustee may be appointed to oversee her affairs.<\/p>\n<p>The time to address these types of issues is before the patient becomes incapacitated. The family should clearly define and explore the topics of living wills, health care proxies, estate planning and powers of attorney now with an experienced elder law attorney.<\/p>\n<p>Taking these proactive actions can be one of the greatest gifts a person can bestow upon herself and her loved ones. It can give a family peace of mind. If you put an advance directive in place, it can provide that gift when it\u2019s needed the most.<\/p>\n<p><em>RELATED ARTICLES:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/roanoke.com\/lifestyles\/age-matters-what-to-do-in-absence-of-advance-directive\/article_a04a125c-09a7-5b90-8bbb-0a5f68e201f6.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cWhat to do in absence of advance directive\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-is-an-advance-directive-and-do-i-need-one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>What is an Advance Directive and Do I need One?<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Roanoke Times advises in the recent article \u201cWhat to do in absence of advance directive\u201d to talk to an experienced elder care attorney to coordinate the necessary legal issues, when dementia may be at issue with a parent or other loved one.
