However, that income-replacement function doesn\u2019t have to stop in retirement.<\/p>\n<p>When a spouse passes away during retirement, the surviving spouse frequently struggles financially. Some living expenses might be less when there\u2019s just one person in a household, but the reduction in costs rarely makes up for the drop in income. One of the two Social Security checks the couple was getting goes away, and a pension payment may also be lost or reduced 50% or 75%. Life insurance can be leveraged to make certain there\u2019s sufficient cash to compensate for that missing income. This lets the surviving spouse maintain his or her standard of living in retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Why should I have Life Insurance in My Estate Plan? There are several sections of the tax laws that give life insurance income tax and transfer tax benefits. For example, death benefits typically are paid income-tax-free to beneficiaries and may also be free from estate taxes, provided the estate stays under the taxable limit. Also, any benefits paid prior to the insured\u2019s death because of chronic or terminal illness also are tax-free. This is called an accelerated death benefit (ADB) and is a pretty new option. If your insurance doesn\u2019t have this coverage, it can probably be added as a rider.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, cash values can grow within a permanent life insurance policy without being subject to income tax. Any cash values more than the policy owner\u2019s tax basis can be borrowed income-tax-free as long as the policy stays in effect. But if you were to pass away prior to paying back your policy loan, the loan balance plus interest accrued is deducted from the death benefit given to the beneficiaries. This may be an issue if your beneficiaries require the entire amount of the intended benefit. When the loan remains unpaid, the interest that accrues is added to the principal balance of the loan. If the loan balance increases above the amount of the cash value, your policy could lapse. That means you could you risk termination by the insurance carrier. If a policy lapses or is surrendered, the loan balance plus interest is considered taxable, and the taxes owed could be pretty hefty based on the initial loan and interest accrued.<\/p>\n<p>There are fees that can includes sales charges, administrative expenses, and surrender charges. That\u2019s in addition to the cost of the insurance, which grows as you age.<\/p>\n<p>Just because\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/are-you-retiring-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\">you\u2019re retired<\/span><\/strong><\/a>\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still need the protections and benefits life insurance can offer you and your family.<\/p>\n<p><em>Reference<\/em>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kiplinger\u00a0<\/strong>(July 10, 2019)\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/article\/insurance\/T034-C032-S014-making-insurance-part-of-your-retirement-plan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cDon\u2019t Overlook Advantages of Making Insurance Part of Your Retirement Plan\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019re not alone if you don\u2019t fully understand the value and benefits that life insurance can give you as part of a retirement plan.
