O\u2019Rourke<\/p>\n<p>Without the right documents in place, you do not have the legal right to protect your own children, once they turn 18, says\u00a0<em>The National Law Review<\/em>\u00a0in an unsettling but must-read article titled\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.natlawreview.com\/article\/three-critical-legal-documents-every-parent-should-get-place-now-to-safeguard-their\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cThree Critical Legal Documents Every Parent Should Get in Place Now to Safeguard Their Adult Children.\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are only three documents and they are fairly straightforward. There is no reason not to have them in place. If your adult child was incapacitated by an accident or an illness, you would want to speak with the medical staff to find out how they are and what decisions need to be made. Whether you were making a phone call or arriving at the hospital, a nurse or doctor would not be permitted to speak with you about your own adult child\u2019s condition or be involved with making any medical decisions.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds unreasonable, and perhaps it is, but that is the law. There are steps you can take to ensure that you are not in this situation.<\/p>\n<p>HIPAA Authorization Form gives you the authority to speak with healthcare providers. This is a federal law (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) that safeguards who can access an adult\u2019s private health data. HIPAA prevents healthcare providers from revealing any information to you or anyone else about a patient\u2019s status. The practitioners could face severe penalties for violating HIPAA.<\/p>\n<p>This is why you want to have a\u00a0<strong>HIPAA authorization\u00a0<\/strong>signed by your adult child and naming you as an authorized recipient.\u00a0 This will give you the ability to ask for and receive information about your child\u2019s health status, progress and treatment. This is especially important, if your child is unconscious or in an unresponsive state. The alternative? Going to court. That\u2019s not what you want to be doing during a health emergency.<\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0<strong>Healthcare Power of Attorney<\/strong>\u00a0or health care proxy needs to be in place, so you can be named his or her \u201cmedical agent\u201d and have the ability to view their medical records and make informed decisions on their behalf. Without this (or a court-appointed guardianship), healthcare decisions will be in the hands of healthcare providers only. That\u2019s not a bad thing, if you implicitly trust your child\u2019s doctor. However, if your child is incapacitated in an out-of-town hospital with healthcare providers you don\u2019t know, you will want to be able to make decisions on his or her behalf.<\/p>\n<p>Note that physicians prefer a single medical agent, not a handful. The concern is that if time is a critical factor and a group of family members do not agree on care, it may compromise the healthcare services that can be provided. You can name multiple agents in priority order. A mother might be listed as the medical agent, and if she is unable or unwilling to serve, the second person would be the father.<\/p>\n<p>The third document is a\u00a0<strong>General Power of Attorney.<\/strong>\u00a0This would give you the right to make financial decisions on your child\u2019s behalf, if they were to become incapacitated. You would have the legal right to manage bank accounts, pay bills, sign tax returns, apply for government benefits, break or apply a lease and conduct activities on behalf of your child.\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/kids-grown-up-protect-them-with-these-three-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Without this document<\/strong><\/a><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frankbrunolaw.com\/kids-grown-up-protect-them-with-these-three-documents\/#\">,<\/a>\u00a0you won\u2019t be able to help your child without a court-appointed guardianship.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these documents need to be updated every few years. If you try to use an older document, the bank or hospital may not accept them. Your adult child also has the ability to revoke these documents at any time, just by saying they revoke them or by putting it in writing. If you have an adult child living out of state, you want to have these documents prepared for your home state and their state of residence.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, this is not a time to download forms and hope for the best. An estate planning attorney will know more specifically what forms are used in your state and help you make sure that they are prepared correctly.<\/p>\n<p><em>Reference:<\/em>\u00a0<strong>The National Law Review<\/strong>\u00a0(Feb. 11, 2019)\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.natlawreview.com\/article\/three-critical-legal-documents-every-parent-should-get-place-now-to-safeguard-their\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cThree Critical Legal Documents Every Parent Should Get in Place Now to Safeguard Their Adult Children\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have your kids Grown Up?
