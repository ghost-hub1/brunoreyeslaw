Even if your spouse doesn\u2019t cooperate throughout the divorce, there are still ways to dissolve the marriage, but the \u201cdevil is in the details.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Complications often arise when it comes to dividing marital assets, calculating alimony, and determining child support and custody arrangements. This is where having a smart and experienced NY family law attorney is invaluable.<\/p>\n<p>The following issues must typically be settled in a divorce:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/divorce-family-law\/child-custody\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">Child custody<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/divorce-family-law\/child-custody\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Child support<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Division of assets and debts<\/li>\n<li>Spousal maintenance (often known as alimony)<\/li>\n<li>And the emotional toll<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Naturally, child custody and child support won\u2019t be a problem if there are no children involved or if both parties are older than 21.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">What Actually Transpires in Court<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Contrary to what you may have observed in the media, very few divorce cases actually end up in court. There will be no opportunity for you to give a testimony or \u201cexplain your side of the story\u201d to a judge.<\/p>\n<p>What does take place is a meeting between the judge and your attorney, usually in the judge\u2019s chambers. Your attorney will fight for you and provide the judge with a summary of the crucial points in your divorce. The lawyer for your soon-to-be ex-spouse will also be permitted to address the judge. The Judge can issue a few temporary Orders or share with the counsel his or her overall assessment of the situation, which will direct the lawyers toward a favorable resolution of the case.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">Contact us Today<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As you can see, the divorce procedure in New York is quite difficult.

An annulment is similar to a divorce in that it can end a marriage. However, a divorce ends a valid marriage while an annulment declares the marriage void as if it never existed.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the facts of your marriage, a divorce will be possible while an annulment will only be feasible if certain conditions are met. These conditions include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Being less than the age of 18 when marrying and having no sexual relationship with your spouse after turning 18.<br \/>\n\u2013 Having entered into the marriage by fraud or trickery.<br \/>\n\u2013 You or your spouse were already married to someone else at the time of your marriage.<br \/>\n\u2013 There is too close a familial relationship between you and your spouse.<br \/>\n\u2013 Impotence.<br \/>\n\u2013 A mental condition prevented you or your spouse from making an informed decision to marry.<\/p>\n<p>In New York, an annulment requires a judge-led trial and hearing. An annulment requires the filing spouse to establish at least one of the grounds in court, unlike a divorce, which a judge can award after receiving written or sworn testimony without a trial.<\/p>\n<h4><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What happens if my spouse doesn\u2019t want a divorce?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Some might refuse to agree to divorce when their spouse asks for one. If you find yourself in this situation, divorce is still possible. There are several approaches to take, but one of them is to get a default divorce. This is useful when the spouse that does not want a divorce completely ignores everything you\u2019re doing to try and dissolve the marriage.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that while your spouse has no choice in whether a divorce takes place or not, they can still contest the terms of the divorce. This includes child support, custody, alimony, and equitable distribution.<\/p>\n<h2>The Experienced Divorce Attorneys at the Law Offices of Bruno Reyes Can Help You with Your Divorce<\/h2>\n<p>No one enjoys the divorce process.
