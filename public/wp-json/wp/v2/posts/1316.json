Your children might be adults but need financial help because of student loans or other financial pressures. Additional reasons you might need to assist your adult children include things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a child with a disability.<\/li>\n<li>One of your children struggles with substance abuse.<\/li>\n<li>You have a twenty-something or older child, who is in graduate school.<\/li>\n<li>You provide much of the childcare for or you raise one of your grandchildren.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are only a few examples of the reasons you might find yourself having to lend a helping hand to your parents and your adult children.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\">The Financial Impact of Taking Care of Two Generations: Strategies for the \u201cSandwich\u201d Generation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Any of these situations can put demands on your time, energy and finances. People who take care of their older parents and their own children often suffer as a result. For example, these caregivers drive everyone else to their medical appointments but do not have to time to go for routine checkups. There are not enough hours in the day to go for a walk to de-stress or get physical exercise. Sleep deprivation is common among \u201csandwichers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The financial impact of dual caregiving can be both short-term and long-term. If you are constantly picking up medications and groceries for your elderly parents and helping your children financially, you might find yourself having a cash flow strain. The time the double caregiving takes from your schedule can also make it impossible for you to engage in the amount of gainful employment you would like, so you can increase your retirement savings.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\">How to Handle the Stress and Exhaustion of Dual Caregiving: Strategies for the \u201cSandwich\u201d Generation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You are not alone. Many people have walked this path before you. They offer these suggestions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contact your local government agencies, community groups, senior organizations and charitable entities to find as many resources as possible to take some of the weight off of your shoulders<\/strong>.
