The planning for disability and incapacity, to include identifying the people who would make decisions for you, if you become incapacitated and protecting your hard-earned assets from the cost of nursing home care.<\/p>\n<p>Estate planning is focused on transferring assets to the desired people, the way you want, when you want, with minimal court costs, taxes, or unnecessary legal fees and avoiding disputes over an inheritance. Here are some of the things your attorney will need to know, with full disclosure from you:<\/p>\n<p>Family dynamics. Do you have a child out of wedlock? Are you part of a blended family or do you have a child you haven\u2019t seen in years, you need to discuss the child. They may have a legal claim to your estate, and that must be planned for.
