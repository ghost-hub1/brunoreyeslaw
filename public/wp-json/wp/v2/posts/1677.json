One reason why people don\u2019t take care of this simple task, is because they don\u2019t fully understand why estate planning is needed. They think it\u2019s only for the wealthy, or that it\u2019s only for old people, or even that it\u2019s only about death and taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this idea: an estate plan is about protecting yourself while you are alive, protecting your family when you have passed and leaving a legacy for the living.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the main elements of an estate plan are to create and execute documents that provide for incapacity and death, as well as provide information about your assets, liabilities and wishes.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve spent a lifetime accumulating assets. It is now time to sit down with family members and have a heart-to-heart talk about the details of the estate and what your intentions are with respect to its distribution. The subject of death can be challenging for all. However, discussing your estate plan is vital, if you want to protect your family from what might come after you are gone. Each family has its own goals, so it\u2019s a good idea to talk about it frankly, while you still can.<\/p>\n<p>Without discussions and an estate, the chances of a family split, assets not going where you had intended and unnecessarily higher costs in taxes and legal fees, are a very real possibility.<\/p>\n<p>If speaking about these topics is too hard, you may want to write your family a love letter. It would contain all the information that your family would need at the time of your death or if you become incapacitated because of illness or injury.<\/p>\n<p>Your estate plan should also include the documents needed, so your family can make decisions on your behalf, if you are incapacitated. That includes a power of attorney, a health care directive and may include others specific to your situation.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, all this information will be located in one convenient place. Don\u2019t put it on a computer where you use a password. If the family cannot access your computer, all your hard work will be useless to them. Put it in a folder or a notebook, that is clearly labeled and tell family members where it is.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ll need this information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list of your important contacts \u2014 your estate planning attorney, financial advisor, CPA, insurance broker and medical professionals.<\/li>\n<li>Credit card information, frequent flier miles.<\/li>\n<li>Insurance and benefits including all health, life, disability, long-term care, Medicare, property deeds, employment and any military benefits.<\/li>\n<li>Documents including your will, power of attorney, birth certificates, military papers, divorce decrees and citizenship papers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Think of these materials and discussions as your opportunity to\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/a-love-letter-to-your-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>make a statement for the future generation<\/strong><\/a><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frankbrunolaw.com\/a-love-letter-to-your-family\/#\">.<\/a>\u00a0If you don\u2019t have an estate plan in place already or if you have not reviewed your estate plan in more than a few years, it\u2019s time to make an appointment for a review.
