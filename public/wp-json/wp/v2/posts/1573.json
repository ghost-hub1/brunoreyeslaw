However, consider the alternative, which could be family battles, unnecessary taxes and an extended probate process. These issues and others can be avoided by creating a trust.<\/p>\n<p>Barron\u2019s recent article,\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/trust-estate-planning-51550696439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cWhy a Trust Is a Great Estate-Planning Tool \u2014 Even if You\u2019re Not Rich,\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0explains that there are many types of trusts, but the most frequently used for these purposes is a revocable living trust. This trust allows you\u2014the grantor\u2014to specify exactly how your estate will be distributed to your beneficiaries when you die, and at the same time avoiding probate and stress for your loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>When you speak with an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/using-trusts-to-maintain-control-of-inheritances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em>estate planning attorney about setting up a trust<\/em><\/span><\/strong>,<\/a> also ask about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-the-must-have-estate-planning-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em>your will, healthcare directives, a living will and powers of attorney<\/em><\/span><\/strong>.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Your attorney will have retitle your probatable assets to the trust. This includes brokerage accounts, real estate, jewelry, artwork, and other valuables. Your attorney can add a pour-over will to include any additional assets in the trust. Retirement accounts and insurance policies aren\u2019t involved with probate, because a beneficiary is named.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re still alive, you have control over the trust and can alter it any way you want. You can even revoke it altogether.<\/p>\n<p>A revocable trust doesn\u2019t require an additional tax return or other processing, except for updating it for a major life event or change in your circumstances. The downside is because the trust is part of your estate, it doesn\u2019t give much in terms of tax benefits or asset protection. If that was your focus, you\u2019d use an irrevocable trust. However, once you set up such a trust it can be difficult to change or cancel. The other benefits of a revocable trust are clarity and control\u2014 you get to detail exactly how your assets should be distributed. This can help protect the long-term financial interests of your family and avoid unnecessary conflict.<\/p>\n<p>If you have younger children, a trust can also instruct the trustee on the ages and conditions under which they receive all or part of their inheritance. In second marriages and blended families, a trust removes some of the confusion about which assets should go to a surviving spouse versus the children or grandchildren from a previous marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Trusts can have long-term legal, tax and financial implications, so it\u2019s a good idea to work with an experienced estate planning attorney.<\/p>\n<p>Reference: Barron\u2019s (February 23, 2019) <span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><strong>\u201c<a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/trust-estate-planning-51550696439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Why a Trust Is a Great Estate-Planning Tool \u2014 Even if You\u2019re Not Rich<\/em><\/a>\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you ask yourself \u201cshould Create a Trust If I\u2019m not Rich?\u201d then these are the answers for you.<\/p>\n<p><em>RELATED ARTICLE:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/trust-estate-planning-51550696439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>\u201cWhy a Trust Is a Great Estate-Planning Tool \u2014 Even if You\u2019re Not Rich,\u201d<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/using-trusts-to-maintain-control-of-inheritances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em>Estate Planning Attorney About Setting Up A Trust<\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cYour true assets are the collections of your quality moments on the earth.\u201d\u2015 Amit Ray, Mindfulness Living in the Moment \u2013 Living in the Breath Carve your name on hearts, not tombstones.
