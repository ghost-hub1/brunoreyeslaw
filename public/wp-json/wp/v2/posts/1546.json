Let\u2019s examine the main reasons why:<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Avoiding probate<\/strong>. This is a big reason why the importance of estate planning is for everyone. You don\u2019t have to be part of the 1% to want to avoid putting your family through the stress and expense of probate. Creating a trust and strategically placing assets within its control, eliminates many headaches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining control from the grave<\/strong>. Even after death, you can still impact how your assets are distributed, as well as to whom and when.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Protecting your legacy<\/strong>. When you consider leaving a legacy for the next generation, it may have lofty pursuits. However, those aren\u2019t necessarily reasonable goals for everyone. Leaving a legacy can also mean making certain that heirs properly respect all the effort and sacrifice that it took to save and create a retirement fund\u2014whatever its size.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating a business succession plan<\/strong>. Among the countless small businesses in the U.S., most will continue to remain viable after the legacy owner dies. A business owner can plan for this within an estate plan, which details exactly what they want to happen, if they die unexpectedly. That could include outlining specific roles and responsibilities for surviving heirs or putting into place a buy-sell agreement with a business partner and directing the distribution the proceeds of the sale.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to revisit your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-the-must-have-estate-planning-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">estate plan regularly<\/span><\/strong><\/a>, especially if your life includes big events, like a birth of a child, a divorce, or an irreconcilable difference with a loved one.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a myth that estate planning is something only wealthy people do.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-the-must-have-estate-planning-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">It\u2019s for everyone<\/span><\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Reference:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forbes<\/strong>\u00a0(April 15, 2019)\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2019\/04\/15\/why-estate-planners-arent-just-for-the-ultra-rich\/?sh=6a2ad5843d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cWhy Estate Planners Aren\u2019t Just For The Ultra-Rich\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Related Articles:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2019\/04\/15\/why-estate-planners-arent-just-for-the-ultra-rich\/?sh=4b8d48e83d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cWhy Estate Planners Aren\u2019t Just for the Ultra-Rich\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-the-must-have-estate-planning-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em>\u201cWhat are the\u00a0Must Have\u00a0Estate Planning Documents?\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to estate planning, you may think that you don\u2019t have the wealth that would require you to engage in extensive estate planning.
