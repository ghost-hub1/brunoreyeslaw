But while the will is very important, it has certain limitations and a few commonly used estate planning strategies can result in unpleasant endings, if this is the only document used.<\/p>\n<p>Spouses often leave everything to each other as the primary beneficiary on death, with all of their children as contingent beneficiaries. This is based on the assumption that the second spouse will remain in the family home, then will distribute any proceeds equally between the children, if and when they move or die. However, the will can be changed at any time before death, as long as the person making the will has mental capacity. If when the first spouse dies, the relationship with the surviving children is not strong, it is possible that the surviving spouse may have their will changed.<\/p>\n<p>If stepchildren don\u2019t have a strong connection with the surviving spouse, which occurs frequently when the second marriage occurs after the children are adults, things can go wrong. Their mutual grief at the passing of the first spouse does not always draw stepchildren and stepparents together. Often, it divides them.<\/p>\n<p>The couple may also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/why-you-and-everyone-needs-an-estate-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\">select different successor beneficiaries<\/span><\/strong><\/a>. The husband may name his wife first, then only his children in his will, while the wife may name her husband and then her children in her will. This creates a \u201csurvival race.\u201d Winner takes all. The surviving spouse receives the property and the children of the spouse who passed won\u2019t know when or if they will receive any assets.<\/p>\n<p>Some couples plan on using trusts for property distribution upon death. This can be more successful, if planned properly. It can also be just as bad as a will.<\/p>\n<p>Trust provisions can be categorized according to the level of control the surviving spouse has after the death of the first spouse. A trust can be structured to lock down half of the trust assets on the death of the first spouse. The surviving spouse remains as a beneficiary but does not have the ability to change the ultimate distribution of the decedent\u2019s portion. This allows the survivor the financial support they need, giving flexibility for the survivor to change their beneficiaries for their remaining share.<\/p>\n<p>Not all blended families actually \u201cblend,\u201d but for those who do, a candid discussion with all, possibly in the office of the estate planning attorney, to plan for the future, is one way to ensure that the family remains a family, when both parents are gone.<\/p>\n<p><em>Reference:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>The News Enterprise\u00a0<\/strong>(November 4, 2019)<strong>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thenewsenterprise.com\/features\/seniors\/blended-families-have-unique-considerations-in-estate-planning\/article_3c75d198-30c1-5121-970e-1ca1f47579c8.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cBlended families have unique considerations in estate planning\u201d<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Estate planning for blended families is like playing chess in three dimensions: even those who are very good at chess can struggle with so many moving parts in so many dimensions.
