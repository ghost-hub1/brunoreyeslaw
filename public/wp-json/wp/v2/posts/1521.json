A trust can be a useful tool for passing on assets, allowing them to be held by a responsible trustee for beneficiaries. However, determining which type of trust is best for each family\u2019s situation and setting them up so they work with an estate plan, can be complex. You\u2019ll do better with the help of an estate planning attorney, says The Street in the article \u201cHow to Set Up a Trust Fund: What You Need to Know.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Depending upon the assets, a trust can help avoid estate taxes that might make the transfer financially difficult for those receiving the assets. The amount of control that is available with a trust, is another reason why they are a popular estate planning tool.<\/p>\n<p>First, make sure that you have enough assets to make using a trust productive. There are some tax complexities that arise with the use of trusts. Unless there is a fair amount of money involved, it may not be worth the expense. Once you\u2019ve made that decision, it\u2019s time to consider what type of trust is needed.<\/p>\n<p>Revocable Trusts are trusts that can be changed. If you believe that you will live for a long time, you may want to use a revocable trust, so you can make changes to it, if necessary. Because of its flexibility, you can change beneficiaries, terminate the trust, or leave it as is. You have options. Once you die, the revocable trust becomes irrevocable and distributions and assets shift to the beneficiaries.<\/p>\n<p>A revocable trust avoids probate for the trust, but will be counted as part of your \u201cestate\u201d for estate tax purposes. They are includable in your estate, because you maintain control over them during your lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>They are used to help manage assets as you age, or help you maintain control of assets, if you don\u2019t believe the trustees are not ready to manage the funds.<\/p>\n<p>Irrevocable Trusts cannot be changed once they have been implemented. If estate taxes are a concern, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll consider this type of trust. The assets are given to the trust, thus removing them from your taxable estate.<\/p>\n<p>Deciding whether to use an irrevocable trust is not always easy. You\u2019ll need to be comfortable with giving up complete control of assets.<\/p>\n<p>These are just two of many different types of trusts. There are trusts set up for distributions to pay college expenses, Special Needs Trusts for disabled individuals, charitable trusts for philanthropic purposes and more. Your estate planning attorney will be able to identify what trusts are most appropriate for your situation.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to prepare for your meeting with an estate planning attorney:<\/p>\n<p>List all of your assets. List everything you might want to place in a trust: including accounts, investments and real estate.<\/p>\n<p>List beneficiaries. Include primary and secondary beneficiaries.<\/p>\n<p>Map out the specifics. Who do you want to receive the assets? How much do you want to leave them? You should be as detailed as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Choose a trustee. You\u2019ll need to name someone you trust implicitly, who understands your financial situation and who will be able to stand up to any beneficiaries who might not like how you\u2019ve structured your trust. It can be a professional, if there are no family members or friends who can handle this task.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to fund the trust. This last step is very important. The trust document does no good, if the trusts are not funded. You may do better letting your estate planning attorney handle this task, so that accounts are properly titled with assets and the trusts are properly registered with the IRS.<\/p>\n<p>How Do Trusts Work in Your Estate Plan? Creating a trust fund can be a complex task. However, with the help of an experienced estate planning attorney, this strategy can yield a lifetime of benefits for you and your loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>Reference:\u00a0<em><strong>The Street (July 22, 2019)\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/how-to\/how-to-set-up-a-trust-fund-15025700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cHow to Set Up a Trust Fund: What You Need to Know\u201d<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>RELATED ARTICLE:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/how-to\/how-to-set-up-a-trust-fund-15025700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cHow to Set Up a Trust Fund: What You Need to Know.\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Do Trusts Work in Your Estate Plan?
