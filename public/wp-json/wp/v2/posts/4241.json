Most of these recipients are retirees who worked and paid Social Security taxes. But millions of dependents and survivors of retired workers, including spouses and ex-spouses, also receive a monthly benefit from Social Security.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Spouses can collect Social Security benefits based on their fellow spouse\u2019s work records.

This is attributed to demographic and economic reasons that include a longer average lifespan, lower labor force participation, and an \u201cearnings gap\u201d that can lead to women receiving a lower Social Security benefit than men.<\/div>\n<h2>Social Security Spousal Benefits<\/h2>\n<div>To address the benefit disparity between men and women, while accounting for women\u2019s now much-higher labor force participation and the increase in the number of divorces, the SSA has over the years modified how it administers Social Security spousal benefits. This includes allowing same-sex spouses to receive spousal benefits in the same way as opposite-sex spouses.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Today, many individuals who qualify for spousal benefits do so based on their spouse\u2019s work records and their own work records.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>As a spouse, you can claim Social Security benefits based on your own earnings record. Or you can collect a spousal benefit up to 50 percent of your spouse\u2019s Social Security benefit.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Those who qualify for both do not receive both in full, but they are automatically entitled to whichever benefit is higher, and they can collect on their spouse\u2019s record even if they never worked.<\/div>\n<div>You are eligible to receive Social Security spousal benefits when you turn 62 years old if your spouse is receiving retirement or disability benefits. However, if you choose to receive spousal benefits before you reach full retirement age (age 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later), your benefit amount will be permanently reduced.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>These rules don\u2019t apply to some child caregivers. If you are caring for a child younger than 16, or who has a disability and is entitled to receive benefits on your spouse\u2019s record, you can qualify for Social Security spousal benefits at any age. Having a qualifying child in your care also means that you\u2019ll receive your full spouse\u2019s benefit even if you are under full retirement age.<\/div>\n<div>Spouses who do not have a qualifying child in their care and begin receiving benefits before full retirement age can use this\u00a0<a id=\"m_-580831853074292476OWA2dbcda9e-aa8e-d03f-23e4-07098d4a84e6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/quickcalc\/spouse.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/quickcalc\/spouse.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iv69XPt_rLZy-iqtOHXnx\">calculator<\/a>\u00a0to see how much their spousal benefit will be reduced.<\/div>\n<h2>Social Security Benefits for Divorced Spouses<\/h2>\n<div>As a divorced spouse, you can collect benefits on your ex-spouse\u2019s record, even if the ex-spouse has remarried and the ex-spouse\u2019s new spouse is collecting on the same record.<\/div>\n<div>To qualify for a divorced spouse Social Security benefit, you must meet the following requirements:<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>You were married for at least 10 years (although the marriage could have been briefly interrupted by divorce during this period; see below).<\/li>\n<li>You are currently unmarried.<\/li>\n<li>You are at least 62 years old.<\/li>\n<li>Your ex-spouse is eligible for retirement benefits.<\/li>\n<li>The benefit you are entitled to receive based on your own work record is less than the benefit you would receive based on your ex-spouse\u2019s work record.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>If your ex-spouse has not yet applied for retirement benefits but can qualify for them, you can receive benefits on their record, provided you have been divorced for at least two continuous years.<\/div>\n<div>And if you are eligible for both a spouse\u2019s benefit and your own retirement benefit, you may have a choice between the two benefits, depending on your age,\u00a0<a id=\"m_-580831853074292476OWA3a141243-9b60-ed8e-52b4-8f80dfcda09d\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/benefits\/retirement\/planner\/applying7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/benefits\/retirement\/planner\/applying7.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1h7YG00agTxMBxCfjEOExo\">explains the SSA<\/a>.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Any Social Security benefits that you receive on an ex-spouse\u2019s record may be reduced by you continuing to work and\/or receiving a pension from a government employer that wasn\u2019t required to withhold Social Security taxes.<\/div>\n<h2>Divorced Spouse Benefits and Remarriage<\/h2>\n<div>If you remarry, you generally can&#8217;t receive benefits on your former spouse\u2019s record unless the new marriage ends (by death, divorce, or annulment).
