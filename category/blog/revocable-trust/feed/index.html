										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate Plan for Blended Family. There are several things that blended families need to consider when updating their estate plans, says The University Herald in the article<em> <strong><span style="color: #3bb4c9;"><a style="color: #3bb4c9;" href="https://www.universityherald.com/articles/76367/20190629/the-challenges-and-complexities-of-estate-planning-for-blended-families.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“The Challenges and Complexities of Estate Planning for Blended Families.”</a></span></strong></em></p>
<p>Estate plans should be reviewed and updated, whenever there’s a major life event, like a divorce, marriage or the birth or adoption of a child. If you don’t do this, it can lead to disastrous consequences after your death, like giving all your assets to an ex-spouse.</p>
<p>If you have children from previous marriages, <strong><span style="color: #3bb4c9;"><a style="color: #3bb4c9;" href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/what-are-common-mistakes-that-people-make-with-beneficiary-designations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make sure they inherit the assets you desire after your death</a></span></strong>. When new spouses are named as sole beneficiaries on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and other accounts, they aren’t legally required to share any assets with the children.</p>
<p>Take time to review and update your estate plan. It will save you and your family a lot of stress in the future.</p>
<p>Your estate planning attorney can help you with this process.</p>
<p>You may need more than a simple will to protect your biological children’s ability to inherit. If you draft a will that leaves everything to your new spouse, he or she can cut out the children from your previous marriage altogether. Ask your attorney about a trust for those children. There are many options.</p>
<p>You can create a trust that will leave assets to your new spouse during his or her lifetime, and then pass those assets to your children, upon your spouse’s death. This is known as an AB trust. There is also a trust known as an ABC trust. Various assets are allocated to each trust, and while this type of trust can be a little complicated, the trusts will ensure that wishes are met, and everyone inherits as you want.</p>
<p>Be sure you that select your trustee wisely. It’s not uncommon to have tension between your spouse and your children. The trustee may need to serve as a referee between them, so name a person who will carry out your wishes as intended and who respects both your children and your spouse.</p>
<p>Another option is to simply leave assets to your biological children upon your death. The only problem here, is if your spouse is depending upon you to provide a means of support after you have passed.</p>
<p>An experienced estate planning attorney will be able to help you map <span style="color: #3bb4c9;"><strong><a style="color: #3bb4c9;" href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out a plan so that no one is left behind</a></strong></span>. The earlier in your second (or subsequent) married life you start this process, the better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate planning for blended families is like playing chess in three dimensions: even those who are very good at chess can struggle with so many moving parts in so many dimensions. Preparing an estate plan requires careful consideration of family dynamics, and those are multiplied in blended families. This is another reason why estate plans need to be tailored for each family’s circumstances, as described in the article <strong><span style="color: #3bb4c9;"><em><a style="color: #3bb4c9;" href="https://www.thenewsenterprise.com/features/seniors/blended-families-have-unique-considerations-in-estate-planning/article_3c75d198-30c1-5121-970e-1ca1f47579c8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Blended families have unique considerations in estate planning”</a></em> </span></strong>from The News Enterprise.</p>
<p>The last will and testament is often<span style="color: #3bb4c9;"><strong> <a style="color: #3bb4c9;" href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/someday-is-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered the key document in an estate plan</a></strong></span>. But while the will is very important, it has certain limitations and a few commonly used estate planning strategies can result in unpleasant endings, if this is the only document used.</p>
<p>Spouses often leave everything to each other as the primary beneficiary on death, with all of their children as contingent beneficiaries. This is based on the assumption that the second spouse will remain in the family home, then will distribute any proceeds equally between the children, if and when they move or die. However, the will can be changed at any time before death, as long as the person making the will has mental capacity. If when the first spouse dies, the relationship with the surviving children is not strong, it is possible that the surviving spouse may have their will changed.</p>
<p>If stepchildren don’t have a strong connection with the surviving spouse, which occurs frequently when the second marriage occurs after the children are adults, things can go wrong. Their mutual grief at the passing of the first spouse does not always draw stepchildren and stepparents together. Often, it divides them.</p>
<p>The couple may also <a href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/why-you-and-everyone-needs-an-estate-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #3bb4c9;">select different successor beneficiaries</span></strong></a>. The husband may name his wife first, then only his children in his will, while the wife may name her husband and then her children in her will. This creates a “survival race.” Winner takes all. The surviving spouse receives the property and the children of the spouse who passed won’t know when or if they will receive any assets.</p>
<p>Some couples plan on using trusts for property distribution upon death. This can be more successful, if planned properly. It can also be just as bad as a will.</p>
<p>Trust provisions can be categorized according to the level of control the surviving spouse has after the death of the first spouse. A trust can be structured to lock down half of the trust assets on the death of the first spouse. The surviving spouse remains as a beneficiary but does not have the ability to change the ultimate distribution of the decedent’s portion. This allows the survivor the financial support they need, giving flexibility for the survivor to change their beneficiaries for their remaining share.</p>
<p>Not all blended families actually “blend,” but for those who do, a candid discussion with all, possibly in the office of the estate planning attorney, to plan for the future, is one way to ensure that the family remains a family, when both parents are gone.</p>
