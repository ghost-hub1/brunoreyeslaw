Most of these recipients are retirees who worked and paid Social Security taxes. But millions of dependents and survivors of retired workers, including spouses and ex-spouses, also receive a monthly benefit from Social Security.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Spouses can collect Social Security benefits based on their fellow spouse’s work records. These benefits are also available to divorced spouses who meet certain criteria, even after their ex-spouse has remarried. <a href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/divorce-family-law/">Divorced</a> spouses are entitled to survivor benefits as well in some situations.</div>
<h2>Social Security Auxiliary Benefits</h2>
<div>Social Security provides monthly benefit payments to retired and disabled workers. It also pays dependent benefits and survivor benefits — collectively known as auxiliary benefits — to the spouses, former spouses, children, parents, and widows/widowers of retired, disabled, and deceased workers. In fact, more than 30 percent of new Social Security benefit awards in 2020 were auxiliary benefits.</div>
<div>Retirement benefits make up the lion’s share (78.9 percent) of Social Security payments. Retired workers collect most of these payments (75.1 percent), according to Social Security Administration (SSA) <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA3eb229fa-ab12-62f3-35c2-a60d1fb79695" href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw36n8gFZVs0ZW6GBTmBum6T">data</a>. But the spouses of retired workers are the second most common recipient of Social Security retirement benefits.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As of March 2024, about 1.8 million spouses of retired workers — most of them <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA44dc308a-7e0a-da5b-e5eb-a795311756fa" href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/social-security-spousal-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/social-security-spousal-benefits/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dSFWIn6hzk2pHhzvX2rzz">women</a> — received Social Security benefits averaging $911 per month. Divorced spouses <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA5bb1de3a-9553-3300-5154-09d7c6389a3e" href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2023/6d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2023/6d.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YzIqh_sc1skcdfwO7MIxq">comprise</a> approximately 12 percent of all spousal benefit awardees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Social Security benefits are also available to surviving spouses. The survivor’s benefit is based on the deceased spouse’s lifetime earnings.</div>
<div>Survivor benefits make up about 8.6 percent of all Social Security benefits, with monthly payments totaling $8.7 million and an average payment of just over $1,500 per month. Widows and widowers comprise about 65 percent of survivor beneficiaries.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In a 2021 <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA20993b9e-9413-4014-54da-bd97bc8da963" href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41479.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41479.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NSFW7mg5sLzXFAQaEXNHT">report</a>, the Congressional Research Service notes that spousal and survivor benefits were added to the Social Security system in 1939, when the majority of U.S. households consisted of a single earner, generally the husband.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Despite most women now working full-time — and <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA8e1d5188-4a78-f59a-d84c-93353fd96fe2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/more-women-are-out-earning-their-husbands-in-the-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/more-women-are-out-earning-their-husbands-in-the-us.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hntKE1lHwKrTDrmkNdnWC">increasingly out-earning</a> their husbands — women are vulnerable to poverty in old age, says the report. This is attributed to demographic and economic reasons that include a longer average lifespan, lower labor force participation, and an “earnings gap” that can lead to women receiving a lower Social Security benefit than men.</div>
<h2>Social Security Spousal Benefits</h2>
<div>To address the benefit disparity between men and women, while accounting for women’s now much-higher labor force participation and the increase in the number of divorces, the SSA has over the years modified how it administers Social Security spousal benefits. This includes allowing same-sex spouses to receive spousal benefits in the same way as opposite-sex spouses.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today, many individuals who qualify for spousal benefits do so based on their spouse’s work records and their own work records.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a spouse, you can claim Social Security benefits based on your own earnings record. Or you can collect a spousal benefit up to 50 percent of your spouse’s Social Security benefit.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those who qualify for both do not receive both in full, but they are automatically entitled to whichever benefit is higher, and they can collect on their spouse’s record even if they never worked.</div>
<div>You are eligible to receive Social Security spousal benefits when you turn 62 years old if your spouse is receiving retirement or disability benefits. However, if you choose to receive spousal benefits before you reach full retirement age (age 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later), your benefit amount will be permanently reduced.</div>
<div></div>
<div>These rules don’t apply to some child caregivers. If you are caring for a child younger than 16, or who has a disability and is entitled to receive benefits on your spouse’s record, you can qualify for Social Security spousal benefits at any age. Having a qualifying child in your care also means that you’ll receive your full spouse’s benefit even if you are under full retirement age.</div>
<div>Spouses who do not have a qualifying child in their care and begin receiving benefits before full retirement age can use this <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA2dbcda9e-aa8e-d03f-23e4-07098d4a84e6" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iv69XPt_rLZy-iqtOHXnx">calculator</a> to see how much their spousal benefit will be reduced.</div>
<h2>Social Security Benefits for Divorced Spouses</h2>
<div>As a divorced spouse, you can collect benefits on your ex-spouse’s record, even if the ex-spouse has remarried and the ex-spouse’s new spouse is collecting on the same record.</div>
<div>To qualify for a divorced spouse Social Security benefit, you must meet the following requirements:</div>
<ul>
<li>You were married for at least 10 years (although the marriage could have been briefly interrupted by divorce during this period; see below).</li>
<li>You are currently unmarried.</li>
<li>You are at least 62 years old.</li>
<li>Your ex-spouse is eligible for retirement benefits.</li>
<li>The benefit you are entitled to receive based on your own work record is less than the benefit you would receive based on your ex-spouse’s work record.</li>
</ul>
<div>If your ex-spouse has not yet applied for retirement benefits but can qualify for them, you can receive benefits on their record, provided you have been divorced for at least two continuous years.</div>
<div>And if you are eligible for both a spouse’s benefit and your own retirement benefit, you may have a choice between the two benefits, depending on your age, <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA3a141243-9b60-ed8e-52b4-8f80dfcda09d" href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/applying7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/applying7.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1h7YG00agTxMBxCfjEOExo">explains the SSA</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any Social Security benefits that you receive on an ex-spouse’s record may be reduced by you continuing to work and/or receiving a pension from a government employer that wasn’t required to withhold Social Security taxes.</div>
<h2>Divorced Spouse Benefits and Remarriage</h2>
<div>If you remarry, you generally can&#8217;t receive benefits on your former spouse’s record unless the new marriage ends (by death, divorce, or annulment). In such cases, you can claim benefits on either spouse’s record,</div>
<div>as long as each marriage meets eligibly requirements (it lasted at least 10 years, etc.) for divorced spouse benefits.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In limited cases, remarriage does not end benefits obtained on the record of a living former spouse. One of these exceptions applies if you remarry the same person.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A marriage to the same spouse could be interrupted by divorce and remarriage and still <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA1734b87c-e6d1-6791-3da6-5d258eabd903" href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300202005" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300202005&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw35lVndrH20ULyA10fLCu5H">qualify for divorced spouse benefits</a> if the remarriage took place no later than the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the divorce.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA2d15b3b0-0bd6-aa94-b0c0-8356c05d7c0c" href="https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/ex-remarry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/ex-remarry/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3q6WTwT_7DTj-eLHPmqzec">AARP</a>, remarriage also may not terminate your ex-spouse benefits if your new spouse is receiving survivor benefits, divorced spouse benefits, or childhood disability benefits.</div>
<div>Social Security Survivor Benefits for Divorced Spouses</div>
<div></div>
<div>The divorced spouse of a worker who has passed away could be eligible for Social Security payments equal to a surviving spouse benefit. To receive a survivor benefit as a divorced spouse, your marriage must have lasted 10 years or more and you must meet these other <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWAa792a8ca-8fd3-67b4-b9ae-4a38bfead025" href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/4408" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/4408&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-29ZdcNw5GQeYLUBOOMNI">requirements</a>:</div>
<ul>
<li>You are at least age 60 (or between 50 and 59 if you have a disability).</li>
<li>You are not entitled to a Social Security benefit on your own work record that is equal to or higher than a benefit from your deceased ex-spouse.</li>
<li>You are unmarried (unless you qualify for an exception).</li>
</ul>
<div>The 10-year marriage requirement does not apply if you are caring for a child under age 16, or who has a disability, and the child qualifies for benefits on your former spouse’s record. The child must also be the natural or legal adopted child of your former spouse.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a id="m_-580831853074292476OWA90bb0323-5436-333d-9489-b814a72981b7" href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/onyourown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/onyourown.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HwK8IGLvSxW800qdA_r4P">Survivor benefits</a> are equivalent to the deceased worker’s full Social Security benefit amount. However, there is a maximum family amount—typically between 150 percent and 180 percent of a worker’s full retirement benefit—that survivors can collectively receive each month.</div>
<div>The SSA states that a benefit paid to a surviving divorced spouse will not affect the amount of benefits other surviving family members can receive, unless the ex-spouse is a divorced parent caring for the child of a deceased worker, in which case their benefits could affect the benefits of other survivors.</div>
<div>Divorced widow/widower payments are also subject to these SSA rules:</div>
<ul>
<li>If you remarry before age 50 you can&#8217;t collect survivor benefits unless you divorce.</li>
<li>If you remarry between ages 50 and 59 you aren’t eligible for survivor benefits.</li>
<li>If you remarry after age 60 you can still receive survivor benefits based on your former spouse’s record. But if your new spouse is also collecting Social Security benefits, and you would receive a higher amount based on the new spouse’s work record, you will receive the higher amount.</li>
</ul>
<div>Once you reach full retirement age and are eligible for both a survivor benefit and your own retirement benefit, you can choose to take survivor benefits first, letting your own benefits vest and then switching to retirement benefits later if that benefit is larger.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Surviving divorced spouses cannot apply online for survivor’s benefits. Contact the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) to request an in-person appointment at your local Social Security office.</div>
<div>You can use this <a id="m_-580831853074292476OWAd543ba85-65b7-816e-0694-e88b30c2de1e" href="https://ssabest.benefits.gov/benefit-finder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ssabest.benefits.gov/benefit-finder/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1719982743844000&amp;usg=AOvVaw34GvJrJgV_I11S80RUrYet">screening tool</a> to determine your eligibility for the different Social Security benefit programs. You may also benefit from consulting with your elder law attorney.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Divorce is a challenging life event that requires careful consideration and strategic decision-making. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from grief and anger to confusion and sadness. The dissolution of a marriage brings with it a profound sense of loss and can trigger a process of self-reflection. Navigating this emotional terrain is often one of the most challenging aspects of divorce, requiring individuals to confront and process complex feelings. Unfortunately, many individuals inadvertently make common mistakes that can have long-lasting consequences. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some of these pitfalls and offer guidance on how to steer clear of them.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Financial Planning</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common mistakes during divorce is a failure to plan for the financial implications. From dividing assets to understanding alimony and child support, financial planning is crucial. Consult with a financial advisor to gain clarity on your post-divorce financial situation and ensure a fair division of assets.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>One of the most palpable difficulties of divorce lies in the emotional turmoil it unleashes. Divorce is an emotionally charged process, and decisions made in the heat of the moment can lead to regret later on. It’s essential to approach decisions with a clear head and consider the long-term consequences. According to former Judge Bompiani in his interview with the Sun U.S., he advises against letting your emotions get the best of you because they could end up dictating your actions. He exclaimed that, “<em>You cannot fall into the trap of letting your emotions dictate your decisions and actions. You need to treat this divorce like a business. Clear your head by getting the help you may need. Take a step back and look at the whole picture objectively.”</em></p>
<p>Seeking the support of a therapist or counselor can help manage emotions during this challenging time.</p>
<p><strong>Overlooking Legal Counsel</strong></p>
<p>Some individuals attempt to navigate the divorce process without seeking proper legal advice. Having a skilled divorce attorney is essential to protect your rights and ensure a fair settlement. The legal complexities inherent in divorce proceedings add another layer of difficulty. Negotiating custody arrangements, dividing assets, and understanding the legal intricacies involved demand a comprehensive understanding of family law. Seeking professional legal counsel becomes not just a choice but a necessity to navigate the legal maze effectively.</p>
<p>One significant error to avoid is seeking legal guidance from family and friends who are not practicing attorneys. It is crucial to recognize that non-professional advice on divorce, especially concerning complex matters like property division and parental responsibilities, may lead to legal and financial ramifications that have enduring consequences on your life.</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring the Importance of Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Accurate and comprehensive documentation is critical during divorce proceedings. Failing to gather and organize financial records, property deeds, and other relevant documents can complicate the division of assets. Take the time to compile and organize all necessary paperwork to streamline the process.</p>
<p><strong>Disregarding Children’s Well-being</strong></p>
<p>Parents undergoing divorce must prioritize the well-being of their children. Using children as leverage or involving them in disputes can have long-lasting emotional effects. Children are profoundly affected by the divorce of their parents. Adapting to new living arrangements, witnessing parental discord, and navigating changes in family dynamics can be emotionally challenging for them. Coordinating co-parenting efforts and ensuring the emotional well-being of the children require a delicate balance and concerted efforts from both parents.</p>
<p><strong>Posting on Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Social media posts can serve as a double-edged sword in divorce cases. Courts may consider publicly available information when making decisions related to child custody, alimony, and asset division. Therefore, exercising caution about what you share online is crucial to avoid unintentionally affecting the outcome of legal proceedings. Judge Bompiani further reiterated that, <em>“These attorneys are going to be digging through all of your posts and using and twisting everything they can to gain an advantage for their client, so be careful and be smart about it.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not Considering Tax Implications</strong></p>
<p>The financial implications of divorce extend to tax considerations. Failing to account for the tax consequences of asset division and spousal support can lead to unexpected financial burdens. Consult with a tax professional to understand the tax implications and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Verbal Agreements</strong></p>
<p>Avoid entering into verbal agreements with your spouse during divorce proceedings, even in cases of amicable relationships. It is crucial to formalize all agreements in a written settlement document to safeguard your interests. Enforcing oral agreements can be difficult, if not impossible, particularly when a comprehensive written agreement is in place.</p>
<p><strong>Overlooking Legal Counsel</strong></p>
<p>Some individuals attempt to navigate the divorce process without seeking proper legal advice. Having a skilled divorce attorney is essential to protect your rights and ensure a fair settlement. The legal complexities inherent in divorce proceedings add another layer of difficulty. Negotiating custody arrangements, dividing assets, and understanding the legal intricacies involved demand a comprehensive understanding of family law.

Therefore, exercising caution about what you share online is crucial to avoid unintentionally affecting the outcome of legal proceedings. Judge Bompiani further reiterated that, <em>“These attorneys are going to be digging through all of your posts and using and twisting everything they can to gain an advantage for their client, so be careful and be smart about it.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Not Considering Tax Implications</strong></p>
<p>The financial implications of divorce extend to tax considerations. Failing to account for the tax consequences of asset division and spousal support can lead to unexpected financial burdens. Consult with a tax professional to understand the tax implications and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Verbal Agreements</strong></p>
<p>Avoid entering into verbal agreements with your spouse during divorce proceedings, even in cases of amicable relationships. It is crucial to formalize all agreements in a written settlement document to safeguard your interests. Enforcing oral agreements can be difficult, if not impossible, particularly when a comprehensive written agreement is in place.</p>
<p><strong>Rushing the Process</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/divorce-family-law/">Divorce</a> is a complex legal procedure that takes time. Rushing through the process in an attempt to expedite matters can result in oversights and unfavorable outcomes. Patience is key – take the time to thoroughly address all aspects of the divorce to secure a fair resolution.</p>
<p>Despite societal shifts in attitudes towards divorce, a lingering social stigma can cast a shadow over the process. Individuals often grapple with feelings of judgment or isolation, adding a layer of difficulty to an already trying situation. Building a supportive network becomes imperative to counteract the potential social fallout.</p>
<p>Divorce is undoubtedly a challenging experience, but avoiding common mistakes can make the process more manageable. Seeking professional advice, maintaining emotional resilience, and prioritizing thoughtful decision-making are crucial steps in steering the complexities of divorce. By being proactive and properly informed of the legalities, individuals can work towards a smoother transition to the next chapter of their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many,<strong> <span style="color: #3ab3c7;"><a style="color: #3ab3c7;" href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/divorce-family-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divorce</a></span> </strong>is one of the most stressful and unpleasant times in their lives. For others, it’s simply a confusing and inconvenient hurdle to get through. Whichever situation applies to you, you probably want to get things moving along as quickly and as smoothly as possible after making the decision to end your marriage. Even though it might seem like a wise course of action to file for divorce without a lawyer in order to save money, it won’t be as quick or simple as you might think.</p>
<p>While New York law does not require that you have legal representation when filing for a divorce, you’ll discover that there are numerous situations in which you will find yourself in need of a family law attorney’s assistance. You’ll find that it takes a full-time job’s worth of effort and excellent organizational skills to negotiate the numerous documents, deadlines, and processes that make a divorce final and legal.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3ab3c7;">Helping You Get What’s Best for You and Your Family</span></h2>
<p>You probably never imagined that you’d find yourself thinking about a divorce or in a legal fight against someone you thought was the love of your life. The compassionate attorneys at the Law Offices of Bruno Reyes understand this emotional rollercoaster that you’re likely going through.</p>
<p>We understand that you want to get through the divorce quickly and painlessly. But to do this, you’ll need to have the help of a tenacious and knowledgeable NY divorce attorney from the Law Offices of Bruno Reyes by your side.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3ab3c7;">What’s so Complicated About the Process of Divorce?</span></h2>
<p>Getting a divorce is generally a straightforward process when all of the necessary steps and documents are completed to a T. Even if your spouse doesn’t cooperate throughout the divorce, there are still ways to dissolve the marriage, but the “devil is in the details.”</p>
<p>Complications often arise when it comes to dividing marital assets, calculating alimony, and determining child support and custody arrangements. This is where having a smart and experienced NY family law attorney is invaluable.</p>
<p>The following issues must typically be settled in a divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/divorce-family-law/child-custody/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #3ab3c7;">Child custody</span></a></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #3ab3c7;"><a style="color: #3ab3c7;" href="https://frankbrunolaw.com/divorce-family-law/child-custody/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Child support</a> </span></strong></li>
<li>Division of assets and debts</li>
<li>Spousal maintenance (often known as alimony)</li>
<li>And the emotional toll</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, child custody and child support won’t be a problem if there are no children involved or if both parties are older than 21.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3ab3c7;">What Actually Transpires in Court</span></h2>
<p>Contrary to what you may have observed in the media, very few divorce cases actually end up in court. There will be no opportunity for you to give a testimony or “explain your side of the story” to a judge.</p>
<p>What does take place is a meeting between the judge and your attorney, usually in the judge’s chambers. Your attorney will fight for you and provide the judge with a summary of the crucial points in your divorce. The lawyer for your soon-to-be ex-spouse will also be permitted to address the judge. The Judge can issue a few temporary Orders or share with the counsel his or her overall assessment of the situation, which will direct the lawyers toward a favorable resolution of the case.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Getting a Divorce in New York</h2>
<h4><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can I get an annulment instead of a divorce?</strong></h4>
<p>Sometimes. An annulment is similar to a divorce in that it can end a marriage. However, a divorce ends a valid marriage while an annulment declares the marriage void as if it never existed.</p>
<p>Depending on the facts of your marriage, a divorce will be possible while an annulment will only be feasible if certain conditions are met. These conditions include:</p>
<p>– Being less than the age of 18 when marrying and having no sexual relationship with your spouse after turning 18.<br />
– Having entered into the marriage by fraud or trickery.<br />
– You or your spouse were already married to someone else at the time of your marriage.<br />
– There is too close a familial relationship between you and your spouse.<br />
– Impotence.<br />
– A mental condition prevented you or your spouse from making an informed decision to marry.</p>
<p>In New York, an annulment requires a judge-led trial and hearing. An annulment requires the filing spouse to establish at least one of the grounds in court, unlike a divorce, which a judge can award after receiving written or sworn testimony without a trial.</p>
<h4><strong class="schema-faq-question">What happens if my spouse doesn’t want a divorce?</strong></h4>
<p>Some might refuse to agree to divorce when their spouse asks for one. If you find yourself in this situation, divorce is still possible. There are several approaches to take, but one of them is to get a default divorce. This is useful when the spouse that does not want a divorce completely ignores everything you’re doing to try and dissolve the marriage.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that while your spouse has no choice in whether a divorce takes place or not, they can still contest the terms of the divorce. This includes child support, custody, alimony, and equitable distribution.</p>
