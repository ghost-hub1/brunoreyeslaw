You may also want to start creating your \u201cbucket list\u201d \u2014 a list of things you\u2019ve always wanted to do, but never had the time to do while you were working. Getting all of this in order, will speed your waiting time and prepare you better, when the last day of your working life does finally arrive.<\/p>\n<p>Are You Retiring? Here\u2019s What You Need to Know. Whether you are three months or six months from retirement, here are some tips for your to-do list:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social Security<\/strong>. Figure out when the best time for you to take Social Security benefits will be. Can you delay it until age 70? That\u2019s when you\u2019ll get the biggest payout. The earlier you start collecting benefits, the smaller your monthly check will be. Take it early, and you are locked in to this lower rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Health Care<\/strong>. Figuring out how to manage health care costs, is the single biggest worry of retirement for most Americans. An injury that puts you in a nursing care facility can make a huge dent in your retirement funds, even if it\u2019s just for a short while. This is the time of your life, when focusing on your health is most important, even if you\u2019ve been careless in earlier decades. Evaluate your health status and get check ups with your regular physician and your dentist.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Investments<\/strong>. Check with your HR department about when you\u2019ll need to roll over your 401(k) plan. If you transfer the funds into a low-cost IRA, you may save in fees. Work with your financial advisor to determine what your withdrawal rate will be. You may need to reevaluate some of your retirement goals or consider working part time during retirement for a few years.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Medicare<\/strong>. If you\u2019re almost 65, you can start enrolling in Medicare now. The government lets you start the process within three months of your 65th birthday. Start this process, so you are covered, once you are not on the company\u2019s health care plan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expectations<\/strong>. The first six months to a year of retirement can be both wonderful and terrible. While enjoying freedom, many people find it hard to withdraw money from the same accounts they spent so many years building. What if they don\u2019t have enough for a long life? Take a realistic look at your lifestyle, budget, and spending habits, before you retire to make sure you are financially ready to do so. If you think you might work part time, look into the positions that are available in your area and what they pay.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lifestyle<\/strong>. Often, we are so busy planning for the financial side of retirement, that we forget to plan for the \u201csoft\u201d side: what will you do in retirement? Will you volunteer with an organization that has meaning for you? Write the novel you\u2019ve started on a dozen times? Spend more time with your grandchildren? Travel? What will make you feel like your time is being well-spent, and what will make you fulfilled?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t forget the legal plan<\/strong>. Retired or not, you need to have a will, power of attorney, and health care power of attorney\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-the-must-have-estate-planning-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">to protect your family<\/span><\/strong><\/a>, whether you are preparing for retirement or in the middle of your career.
