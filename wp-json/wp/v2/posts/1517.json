You select a primary beneficiary and, in most cases, a contingency beneficiary, who will inherit the asset when you die.<\/p>\n<p>Typical accounts with beneficiary designations are retirement accounts, including 401(k)s, 403(b)s, IRAs, SEPs, life insurance, annuities and investment accounts. Many financial institutions allow beneficiaries to be named on non-retirement accounts, which are most commonly set up as Transfer on Death (TOD) or Pay on Death (POD) accounts.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to name a beneficiary and be confident that your loved one will receive the asset, without having to wait for probate or estate administration to be completed. However, there are some problems that occur and mistakes get expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Forgot to Update Your Beneficiary Designations? Your Ex Will be Delighted. Here are mistakes you don\u2019t want to make:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Failing to name a beneficiary<\/strong>. It\u2019s hard to say whether people just forget to fill out the forms or they don\u2019t know that they have the option to name a beneficiary. However, either way, not naming a beneficiary becomes a problem for your survivors. Each company will have its own rules about what happens to the assets when you die.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/life-insurance-for-elders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em>Life insurance proceeds are typically paid to your probate estate<\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/a>, if there is no named beneficiary. Your family will need to go to court and probate your estate.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to retirement benefits, your spouse will most likely receive the assets. However, if you are not married, the retirement account will be paid to your probate estate. Not only does that mean your family will need to go to court to probate your estate, but taxes will be levied on the asset. When an estate is the beneficiary of a retirement account, all the assets must be paid out of the account within five years from the date of death. This acceleration of what would otherwise be a deferred income tax, must be paid much sooner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Neglecting special family considerations<\/strong>. There may be members of your family who are not well-equipped to receive or manage an inheritance. A family member with special needs who receives an inheritance, is likely to lose government benefits. Therefore, your planning needs to include a SNT \u2014 Special Needs Trust. Minors may not legally claim an inheritance, so a court-appointed person will claim and manage their money until they turn 18. This is known as a conservatorship. Conservatorships are costly to set up. They must also make an annual accounting to the court. Conservators may need to file a bond with the court, which is usually bought from an insurance company. This is another expensive cost.<\/p>\n<p>If you follow this course of action, at age 18 your heir may have access to a large sum of money. That may not be a good idea, regardless of how responsible they might be. A better way to prepare for this situation is to have a trust created. The trustee would be in charge of the money for a period of time that is determined by the personality and situation of your heirs.<\/p>\n<p>Using an incorrect beneficiary name. This happens quite frequently. There may be several people in a family with the same name. However, one is Senior and another is Junior. The person might also change their name through marriage, divorce, etc. Not only can using the wrong name cause delays, but it could lead to litigation, especially if both people believe they were the intended recipient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Failing to update beneficiaries<\/strong>. Just as your will must change when life changes occur, so must your beneficiaries. It\u2019s that simple, unless you really wanted to give your ex a windfall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Failing to review beneficiaries with your estate planning attorney<\/strong>. Beneficiary designations are part of your overall estate plan and financial plan. For instance, if you are leaving a large insurance policy to one family member, it may impact how the rest of your assets are distributed.<\/p>\n<p>Forgot to Update Your Beneficiary Designations? Take the time to review your beneficiary designations, just as you review your estate plan. You have the power to determine how your assets are distributed, so don\u2019t leave that to someone else.<\/p>\n<p>Related Article:\u00a0\u00a0<em><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/article\/retirement\/t021-c032-s014-beneficiary-designations-5-big-mistakes-to-avoid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cBeneficiary Designations: 5 Critical Mistakes to Avoid.\u201d<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/life-insurance-in-my-estate-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\">\u201cLife Insurance in My Estate Plan?\u201d<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your will does not control who inherits all your assets when you die.
