We break it down for you. For example, the federal estate tax kicks in for estates exceeding $13.61 million, but in New York, that number drops to $6.94 million. Without proper planning, a tax bill could erode your carefully built estate. Failing to address an estate of such size could lead to substantial tax liabilities, potentially amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars! Estate tax laws can be complex, and exemption thresholds vary by state.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Power of Trusts:<\/strong>Trusts are like financial shields, protecting your assets from taxes. We&#8217;ll explore options like irrevocable trusts, charitable trusts, and other tax-saving structures to ensure more of your wealth reaches your beneficiaries.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Unlocking Exemptions and Credits:<\/strong>Who doesn&#8217;t love a good tax break? We&#8217;ll help you leverage available exemptions, like the lifetime gift tax exemption and the marital deduction, to minimize your tax burden.
