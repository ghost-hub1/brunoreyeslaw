You have to do it yourself, whether you\u2019re rich or poor, out of money or raking it in, the beneficiary of ridiculous fortune or terrible injustice. And you have to do it no matter what is true. No matter what is hard. No matter what unjust, sad, sucky things befall you. Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive down it. It\u2019s up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out.\u201d Cheryl Strayed<\/p>\n<p>Many people don\u2019t understand that their will doesn\u2019t control who inherits all of their assets when they pass away. Some of a person\u2019s assets pass by beneficiary designation. That\u2019s accomplished by completing a form with the company that holds the asset and naming who will inherit the asset, upon your death. It could be a bank account, financial institution or insurance company. A trust on the other hand only controls assets placed into the trust and your estate planning could be thwarted by beneficiary designations.<\/p>\n<p>Kiplinger\u2019s recent article, \u201cBeneficiary Designations: 5 Critical Mistakes to Avoid,\u201d explains that assets including life insurance, annuities and retirement accounts (think 401(k)s, IRAs, 403bs and similar accounts) all pass by beneficiary designation. Many financial companies also let you name beneficiaries on non-retirement accounts, known as TOD (transfer on death) or POD (pay on death) accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Naming a beneficiary can be a good way to make certain your family will get assets directly. However, these beneficiary designations can also cause a host of problems. Make sure that your beneficiary designations are properly completed and given to the financial company, because mistakes can be costly. The article looks at five critical mistakes to avoid when dealing with your beneficiary designations:<\/p>\n<p>Failing to name a beneficiary. Many people never name a beneficiary for retirement accounts or life insurance. If you don\u2019t name a beneficiary for life insurance or retirement accounts, the financial company has it owns rules about where the assets will go after you die. For life insurance, the proceeds will usually be paid to your estate. For retirement benefits, if you\u2019re married, your spouse will most likely get the assets. If you\u2019re single, the retirement account will likely be paid to your estate, which has negative tax ramifications. When an estate is the beneficiary of a retirement account, the assets must be paid out of the retirement account within five years of death. This means an acceleration of the deferred income tax\u2014which must be paid earlier, than would have otherwise been necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to consider special circumstances. Not every person should receive an asset directly. These are people like minors, those with specials needs, or people who can\u2019t manage assets or who have creditor issues. Minor children aren\u2019t legally competent, so they can\u2019t claim the assets. A court-appointed conservator or guardian will claim and manage the money, until the minor turns 18. Those with special needs who get assets directly, will lose government benefits because once they receive the inheritance directly, they\u2019ll own too many assets to qualify. People with financial issues or creditor problems can lose the asset through mismanagement or debts.\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><strong><em><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/using-trusts-to-maintain-control-of-inheritances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ask your attorney about creating a trust to be named as the beneficiary.<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Designating the wrong beneficiary. Sometimes a person will complete beneficiary designation forms incorrectly. For example, there can be multiple people in a family with similar names, and the beneficiary designation form may not be specific. People also change their names in marriage or divorce. Assets owners can also assume a person\u2019s legal name that can later be incorrect. These mistakes can result in delays in payouts, and in a worst-case scenario of two people with similar names, can mean litigation.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to update your beneficiaries. Since there are life changes, make sure your\u00a0<em>beneficiary designations are updated on a regular basis<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to review beneficiary designations with your attorney. Beneficiary designations are part of your overall financial and estate plan. Speak with your estate planning attorney to determine the best approach for your specific situation.<\/p>\n<p>Beneficiary designations are designed to make certain that you have the final say over who will get your assets when you die. Take the time to carefully and correctly choose your beneficiaries and periodically review those choices and make the necessary updates to stay in control of your money.<\/p>\n<p>Related Articles:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/using-trusts-to-maintain-control-of-inheritances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Using Trusts to Maintain Control of Inheritances<\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201c[In politics] when A goes after B and there\u2019s a C, and D and a Q all lined up there, you have no idea who\u2019s going to be the beneficiary.\u201d Mark Shields \u201cNobody\u2019s going to do your life for you.
