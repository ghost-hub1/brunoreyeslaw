When new spouses are named as sole beneficiaries on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and other accounts, they aren\u2019t legally required to share any assets with the children.<\/p>\n<p>Take time to review and update your estate plan.

If you draft a will that leaves everything to your new spouse, he or she can cut out the children from your previous marriage altogether. Ask your attorney about a trust for those children. There are many options.<\/p>\n<p>You can create a trust that will leave assets to your new spouse during his or her lifetime, and then pass those assets to your children, upon your spouse\u2019s death. This is known as an AB trust. There is also a trust known as an ABC trust. Various assets are allocated to each trust, and while this type of trust can be a little complicated, the trusts will ensure that wishes are met, and everyone inherits as you want.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure you that select your trustee wisely. It\u2019s not uncommon to have tension between your spouse and your children. The trustee may need to serve as a referee between them, so name a person who will carry out your wishes as intended and who respects both your children and your spouse.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to simply leave assets to your biological children upon your death. The only problem here, is if your spouse is depending upon you to provide a means of support after you have passed.<\/p>\n<p>An experienced estate planning attorney will be able to help you map\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">out a plan so that no one is left behind<\/a><\/strong><\/span>.
