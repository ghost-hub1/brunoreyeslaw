However, it is better late than never. It\u2019s easy to put these tasks off, since the busyness of our day-to-day lives gives us a good reason to procrastinate on the larger issues, like death and our own mortality. However, according to Charlotte Five\u2019s article\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.charlottefive.com\/10-documents-future-planning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cFor ultimate adulting status, have these 10 documents by the time you\u2019re 35,\u201d<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0the time to act is now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are the ten documents you need to get locked down.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>A Will<\/strong>. The last will and testament does not have to be complicated. However, it does need to be prepared properly, so that it will be valid. If your family includes minor children, you need to name a guardian. Pick an executor who will be in charge when you pass. If you don\u2019t have a will, the law of your state will determine how your assets are distributed, and a court will name a guardian for your children. It is better to have a will and put your wishes down in writing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Life insurance.<\/strong>\u00a0There are two basic kinds: term insurance, which covers about twenty years, and universal or whole, which covers you for your lifetime. You need enough to cover your liabilities: your home mortgage, college funding for your kids and any outstanding debts, like credit cards or a car loan. This way, you aren\u2019t saddling heirs with your debt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Durable power of attorney.<\/strong>\u00a0This document lets you designate someone to pay your bills, manage your money and make financial decisions for you, if you become incapacitated. Without it, your relatives will need to go to court to be appointed power of attorney. Pick a trusted person and have the form done, when you meet with your estate planning attorney.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Twice your annual income in savings.<\/strong>\u00a0Most Americans don\u2019t do this. However, if you start saving, no matter how small an amount, you\u2019ll be glad you did. You need savings to avoid creating debt, if an emergency occurs. A cash cushion of six months\u2019 worth of monthly expenses in a savings account will give you peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insurance coverage.<\/strong>\u00a0Make sure that you have the right insurance in place, in addition to life insurance. That means health insurance, auto insurance and disability insurance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credit report.<\/strong>\u00a0People with better credit reports get better rates on home and auto loans. You can get them free from the big credit reporting services. Make sure everything is correct, from your address to your account history.<br \/>\nA letter of instruction. Where do you keep your estate planning documents? What about your bank statements, taxes and insurance documents? What about your digital assets? Keep a list for easy access for those who might have to figure out your affairs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retirement plan.<\/strong>\u00a0Most people only know they don\u2019t have enough saved for retirement. That\u2019s not good enough. If you aren\u2019t enrolled in your company\u2019s 401(k) or other retirement savings plan, get on that right away. If your company matches contributions, make sure you are saving enough to get every bit of those matching dollars. If your company doesn\u2019t have a retirement plan, then open an IRA or a Roth IRA on your own. You should try to contribute as much as you possibly can.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Updated resume.<\/strong>\u00a0It also helps to do the same thing with your LinkedIn profile. No matter how long you\u2019ve been in your field, everyone looks at your LinkedIn profile to see who you are and what and who you know. Make sure you have an updated resume, so you can easily send it out, whether it\u2019s a casual conversation about a speaking opportunity or if you\u2019re starting to look for a new position.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A budget.<\/strong>\u00a0Here\u2019s how you know you\u2019re really an adult. Budgets went out of fashion for a while, but now they are bigger than avocado toast. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming in and what\u2019s going out, you can\u2019t possibly have any kind of control or direction over your financial life. Start tracking your expenses, matching with your income and making any necessary changes.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.frankbrunolaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/bucket-list-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>One last thing\u2014do you have a bucket list?
