She should have a will and an Advance Health Care Directive. Talk to an experienced estate planning attorney to make sure these documents fully reflect your mother\u2019s desires. An Advance Health Care Directive lets her name a person to make health care decisions on her behalf, if she becomes incapacitated. This decision-making authority is called a Power of Attorney for Health Care, and the person receiving the authority is known as the agent.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-a-durable-power-of-attorney-can-do\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Based on the way in which the form is written<\/strong><strong>,<\/strong><\/a><\/span> the agent can have broad authority, including the ability to consent to or refuse medical treatment, surgical procedures and artificial nutrition or hydration. The form also allows a person to leave instructions for health care, such as whether or not to be resuscitated, have life prolonged artificially, or to receive treatment to alleviate pain, even if it hastens death.

You should also conduct a full inventory of your parent\u2019s accounts, including where they\u2019re held and how they\u2019re titled. Update the named beneficiaries on IRAs, retirement plans and life insurance policies.<\/p>\n<p>Some adult children will have their parent name them as a joint owner on their checking account. This allows you greater flexibility to settle outstanding obligations, when she passes away. Remember that a financial power of attorney won\u2019t work here, because it will lapse upon your mother\u2019s death. However, note that any asset held by joint owners are subject to the creditors of each joint owner. Do not add your daughter as a joint owner, if she has marital, financial, or legal problems!<\/p>\n<p>How Do I Get My Mom\u2019s Affairs in Order? You also shouldn\u2019t put your name as a joint owner of a brokerage account\u2014especially one with low-cost basis investments. One of the benefits of transferring wealth, is the step-up in cost basis assets receive at time of death. Being named as the joint owner of an account will give you control over the assets in the account\u2014but you won\u2019t get the step up in basis, when your mother passes.<\/p>\n<p><em>RELATED ARTICLE:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><em><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.montereyherald.com\/2019\/03\/20\/financial-planning-making-sure-mom-is-taken-care-of\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monterey Herald (March 20, 2019)<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-a-durable-power-of-attorney-can-do\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>What a Durable Power of Attorney Can Do?<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/is-a-revocable-trust-valuable-in-estate-planning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Is a Revocable Trust Valuable in Estate Planning?<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\"><a style=\"color: #3ab3c7;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/why-should-i-create-a-trust-if-im-not-rich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Why Should I Create a Trust If I\u2019m Not Rich?<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIt is a curious thing, the death of a loved one.
