Many a family has been torn apart by a botched-up will. Each case is a drama in human relationships \u2014 and the lawyer, as counselor, draftsman, or advocate, is an important figure in the dramatis personae. This is one reason the estates practitioner enjoys his work, and why we enjoy ours.\u201d Jesse Dukeminier and Stanley M. Johanson, introduction to 1972 edition of Family Wealth Transactions: Wills, Trust, Future Interests, and Estate Planning.<\/p>\n<p>What do Aretha Franklin, Kurt Cobain, and Prince have in common? Aside from being famous and talented, each of these stars passed away without a will.

If there are no legal instructions in place, probate law dictates the distribution of your assets and selection of guardians for your minor children, which can cause problems. Regardless of your personal situation, you should think about creating these three important estate planning documents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will.\u00a0<\/strong>A will is used to distribute your estate, according to your instructions. A will can say how much and what type of asset each heir will receive, to minimize family fighting after your death. If you have young children, you can designate guardians in your will to be in charge of their care. If you die without a will, the probate judge will order who becomes their guardian.<\/p>\n<p>You also need a will to make charitable bequests,<strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\">\u00a0<a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/kids-grown-up-protect-them-with-these-three-documents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to expedite the probate court process<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>and to reduce or eliminate estate taxes. When you draft your will, you\u2019ll appoint trusted people to serve as the executor and the trustee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Living will.\u00a0<\/strong>A living will can take effect while you are still alive. This is a legal document that sets out your instructions for medical treatment, if you become unable to communicate, such as whether or not you want to be placed on life support. A living will can relieve the emotional burden from your family of having to make difficult decisions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Power of attorney.\u00a0<\/strong>This legal document helps in the event you\u2019re incapacitated or in the hospital in an unresponsive state. A power of attorney gives the individual you designate the authority to transact financial and legal matters on your behalf. Set up a power of attorney, before you need it.
