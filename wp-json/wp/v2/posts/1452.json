It\u2019s very basic: making a list of all of your assets and\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how they are titled<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong> Remember, the estate plan is dealing with the distribution of your assets\u2014so you have to first know what those assets are. If you are old enough to have lived through the sale of several different financial institutions, do you know where your accounts are? Not everyone does!<\/p>\n<p>Next, you need to be clear on how the assets are titled. If they are joint with a spouse, Payable on Death (POD) or Transfer on Death (TOD), jointly with a child, or owned by a trust, they may be treated differently in your estate plan, than if you owned them outright.<\/p>\n<p>Roughly fifty percent of all adults don\u2019t make a plan for their estate. That becomes a huge headache for their loved ones. If you don\u2019t have an estate plan, your property will be distributed according to the laws of your state. What you do or don\u2019t want to have happen to your property won\u2019t matter, and in some instances, your family may be passed over for a long-lost sibling. It\u2019s a risk.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, if you don\u2019t have an estate plan, chances are you haven\u2019t done any tax planning. Some states have inheritance taxes, others have estate taxes, and some have both. Even if your estate\u2019s value doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to the very high federal estate tax level ($11.4 million per person for 2019), your heirs could inherit far less, if state and inheritance taxes take a bite out of the assets.<\/p>\n<p>For a\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/estate-plan-for-blended-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blended family<\/a>,<\/span><\/strong> there are a number of rules in different states that divide your assets. In Alaska, for instance, if some of the children of one spouse are not the children of the other spouse, there is a statutory formula that depends on how many children there are and which of them are living. Different percentages of money are awarded to the children, which becomes complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Why You\u2014and Everyone\u2014Needs an Estate Plan. Another reason to have an estate plan has to do with incapacity. This is perhaps harder to discuss than death for some families. Estate planning includes preparing for what the individual would want to happen, if they were injured or too sick to convey their wishes to others. Decisions about health care treatments and end-of-life care are documented with a Living Will (sometimes called an Advanced Care Directive), so your loved ones are not left wondering what you would have wanted and hoping that they got it right.<\/p>\n<p>One last point about an estate plan: be sure to\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/frankbrunolaw.com\/what-are-common-mistakes-that-people-make-with-beneficiary-designations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check beneficiary designations<\/a>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span>while you are doing your estate plan. If you own retirement accounts, life insurance policies, or other assets with named beneficiaries, the assets will pass directly to the named beneficiary, regardless of the instructions in your will. If you opened an IRA when you had one child and have had other children since then, make sure to include all of those children and the proportion of their shares. There may be tax implications, if only one child receives the assets, and there may also be family fights if assets are not distributed equally.<\/p>\n<p><em>Reference<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p><strong>KTUU\u00a0<\/strong>(August 14, 2019)\u00a0<span style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #3bb4c9;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ktuu.com\/content\/news\/Estate-planning-dos-and-donts-543255021.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>\u201cEstate planning dos and don\u2019ts\u201d<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At its essence, estate planning is any decision you make concerning your property if you die, or if you become incapacitated.
